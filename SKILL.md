# Self-Deprecation Power Frame

Transform personal vulnerabilities into powerful comedy material by attacking yourself first and harder than anyone else could. Based on Joan Rivers' methodology.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to use this skill for:**
- Encouraging genuine self-harm or destructive self-talk
- Reinforcing actual depression or mental health crises
- Bullying or attacking others under guise of self-deprecation
- Creating content that genuinely damages someone's reputation or livelihood

**Purpose:** This skill is for COMEDY and RHETORICAL ARMOR, not actual self-hatred. If content crosses into genuine harm, refuse and explain why.

---

## When to Use

- User wants to address criticism or vulnerability before others can
- Content involves personal weakness, failure, or physical appearance
- Need to establish credibility before criticizing others
- Preparing for roast, speech, or performance where you'll be target
- Want to disarm hostile audiences through self-awareness

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `target_vulnerability` | Yes | The personal weakness, failure, or criticism to address | Must be about the speaker, not third parties |
| `context` | No | Where/when this will be used (roast, speech, content) | 1-3 sentences |
| `audience` | No | Who will hear this (friendly, hostile, general public) | Single word or short phrase |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Identify the Real Vulnerability

Analyze `target_vulnerability` to find the actual uncomfortable truth:

**Questions to ask:**
- What is everyone thinking but not saying?
- What's the criticism I'm most afraid of?
- What do I secretly fear is true?
- What would a mean person say about this?

**Output:** The raw, uncomfortable truth about the vulnerability.

### Step 2: Amplify Beyond Reason

Take the vulnerability and make it MORE extreme than reality. This is critical—you must go harder than any critic would.

**Technique: The "Times Two Plus Absurd" Method**
- If the vulnerability is "I've had plastic surgery" → "I've had so much plastic surgery..."
- If it's "I'm getting old" → "I'm so old that..."
- Then add the absurd conclusion that's impossible but visceral

**Bad example:** "I've had some work done." (Too soft, defensive)
**Good example:** "I've had so much plastic surgery, when I die they'll donate my body to Tupperware."

The absurdity (Tupperware donation) signals this is comedy, not confession.

### Step 3: Make It Visual and Specific

Replace abstract vulnerabilities with concrete, visual details.

**Transformation patterns:**

| Vague | Visual & Specific |
|-------|------------------|
| "I'm not attractive" | "I'm so ugly, when I walk into a bank they turn off the cameras" |
| "I'm overweight" | "I'm so fat, I have my own zip code" |
| "I'm getting old" | "I'm so old, my birth certificate is in Roman numerals" |
| "I failed recently" | "I bombed so hard, they called a bomb squad to disarm me" |

**Key:** The specific detail must be visual (you can "see" it) and slightly absurd (signals comedy, not depression).

### Step 4: Deliver First, Fast, and Often

**Timing rules:**
- Use this EARLY in content (first 30 seconds of speech, opening paragraph)
- Don't apologize or explain—deliver confidently
- If content is long, return to self-deprecation periodically to re-earn credibility

**Opening formulas:**
- "Before anyone else says it..."
- "Let's address the obvious..."
- "I know what you're thinking: [vulnerability]. You're right, and here's the thing..."

## Output Format

```markdown
## Self-Deprecation Power Frame Analysis

**Vulnerability:** [target_vulnerability]

**Uncomfortable Truth:** [what everyone's thinking but not saying]

**Amplified Version:** [vulnerability × 2 + absurd]

**Visual Specific Detail:** [concrete, imageable comparison or metaphor]

**Delivery Line:**
"[Full self-deprecating joke in Joan Rivers style]"

**Strategic Purpose:** [why this joke earns you armor/credibility]

---

**Integration Note:** [how to place this in content—opening, before criticism of others, etc.]
```

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Vulnerability is about someone else | Reject: "This skill is for SELF-deprecation. I can't attack someone else under this framework." |
| Content crosses into genuine harm | Refuse: "This has crossed from comedy to actual harm. Self-deprecation should be armor, not self-destruction." |
| Joke is too soft/defensive | Flag: "This is too gentle. Joan Rivers would go 3x harder. Let me amplify..." |
| No absurd element present | Add absurdity: "This reads as sad truth, not comedy. Adding impossible/absurd element..." |
| Vulnerability too vague | Request specifics: "I need more detail about the actual vulnerability to make this work." |

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**

- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations

```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Examples

### Example 1: Plastic Surgery

**Input:**
- `target_vulnerability`: "I've had cosmetic surgery and people criticize it"
- `context`: "Opening for stand-up set"
- `audience`: "General comedy club audience"

**Output:**

## Self-Deprecation Power Frame Analysis

**Vulnerability:** Had cosmetic surgery, subject to criticism

**Uncomfortable Truth:** People think I've had way too much work done and don't look natural

**Amplified Version:** I've had SO MUCH plastic surgery that...

**Visual Specific Detail:** Body parts being repurposed for household storage (Tupperware)

**Delivery Line:**
"I've had so much plastic surgery, when I die they're going to donate my body to Tupperware. My face is so tight, when I raise my eyebrows, my ankles lift."

**Strategic Purpose:** By making the plastic surgery joke more extreme than any heckler would, I've preemptively disarmed criticism. Anyone who tries to mock my appearance now looks lazy—I already went harder than they could.

---

**Integration Note:** Use in first 30 seconds of set, right after introducing yourself. This establishes you're self-aware and fearless, earning permission to roast others later.

---

### Example 2: Career Failure

**Input:**
- `target_vulnerability`: "My last project was a complete failure"
- `context`: "Pitch meeting for new project"
- `audience`: "Investors and partners who know about the failure"

**Output:**

## Self-Deprecation Power Frame Analysis

**Vulnerability:** Recent high-profile project failure

**Uncomfortable Truth:** Everyone in this room knows I bombed spectacularly and is wondering if I've learned anything

**Amplified Version:** My last project failed SO HARD that...

**Visual Specific Detail:** Failure so complete it became historical reference point

**Delivery Line:**
"Let's address the elephant in the room: my last project bombed so hard, archaeologists want to dig it up and study it as an ancient disaster site. It failed with such precision, I'm considering franchising the failure model to other industries. NASA called asking if they could use my calculations to create a black hole."

**Strategic Purpose:** By making the failure bigger and funnier than it actually was, I demonstrate self-awareness, resilience, and the ability to learn. The absurdity (NASA, archaeologists) signals I've processed it and moved on.

---

**Integration Note:** Use immediately in opening remarks: "Before we discuss the new project, let's talk about the elephant..." This shows confidence and prevents the failure from hanging over the entire meeting.

---

### Example 3: Age

**Input:**
- `target_vulnerability`: "I'm significantly older than my colleagues"
- `context`: "Accepting an industry award"
- `audience`: "Industry peers, many younger"

**Output:**

## Self-Deprecation Power Frame Analysis

**Vulnerability:** Oldest person in the room, potential irrelevance

**Uncomfortable Truth:** Everyone's wondering if I'm still relevant or just being given a lifetime achievement consolation prize

**Amplified Version:** I'm SO OLD that...

**Visual Specific Detail:** Age predating modern conveniences/historical events

**Delivery Line:**
"I'm honored to receive this award, and I'm so old that when I started in this industry, 'streaming' meant you had a cold, 'the cloud' was just weather, and 'going viral' was something you tried to avoid. My first computer was powered by steam engine. I'm so old, my birth certificate is in Roman numerals, and when I was young, the Dead Sea was only sick."

**Strategic Purpose:** By making age ridiculous rather than sad, I've signaled I'm still mentally sharp (the jokes prove it) and self-aware. This earns respect rather than pity.

---

**Integration Note:** Use after accepting award, before launching into thank-yous. This prevents the award from feeling like a "you had a good run, now retire" moment.

## Integration with Joan Rivers Expert

When working with the Joan Rivers expert:
- This skill operationalizes her core "self-deprecation as power" methodology
- Joan Rivers would ALWAYS use this skill first before roasting others
- The visual specificity requirement comes directly from her approach
- The "hit yourself harder than anyone else could" principle is her signature move

**Trigger for Joan Rivers expert:** Any time content involves vulnerability, criticism, or personal weakness, Rivers would automatically apply this framework.

---

## Constraints

- **Hit yourself, not others** - This is SELF-deprecation. Attacking others doesn't earn you armor.
- **Absurdity is required** - Without the impossible element, this becomes genuine self-loathing, not comedy.
- **Visual specificity mandatory** - Vague = forgettable and sad. Specific = funny and memorable.
- **Early placement critical** - Self-deprecation loses power if placed after you've already been criticized.
- **Confidence in delivery** - Delivering these lines tentatively makes them sad. Confident delivery makes them powerful.

---

- [ ] Vulnerability is addressed before others can use it against you
- [ ] Joke is more extreme than any critic would go
- [ ] Visual, specific detail is present (can "see" it)
- [ ] Absurd, impossible element signals comedy not confession
- [ ] Delivered confidently without apology
- [ ] Earns permission to criticize others later
- [ ] Audience laughs WITH you, not AT you
